Code for RNA seq and ChIP seq analysis of Arabidopsis thaliana Col-0 and jmj13 knockout seedlings under day and night conditions. Preliminary lab observations showed larger seed size phenotype of jmj13 mutant. This study aimed to find DEGs and candidate JMJ13 targets that may help to explain bigger seed size of mutant.
